This project is a Basic E-commerce System designed using foundational Python concepts. It provides a simple and functional implementation of an 
online store, demonstrating the use of core programming principles such as variables, lists, arrays, loops, conditionals, sorting, and searching.

This system is intended for beginners to understand how basic programming techniques can be applied to 
solve real-world problems like managing a shopping cart or sorting products.

Features:
1. Username and Password Creation
2. Search Functionality: Search for products by name using a basic search algorithm.
3. Sorting: Products can be sorted by price and rating using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
4. Shopping Cart: Add products to a cart.
5. Checkout System: Calculate the total price of items in the cart with simple math operators.
6. Interactive Menu: Navigate the e-commerce system through print statements and input options.
